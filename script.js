Before starting, make sure you are logged in to CodePen, at the end of the test you will need to export your solution as a zip. The export function can be found in the bottom right corner.

The task is to implement the component seen in the image using only HTML and CSS.
You will be given 40 minutes to achieve as close to pixel perfection as possible while also ensuring good code quality.

The test is extremely stressful. It will show how comfortable you are with basic technologies. In order to get a good result in the time given you will need to work in an organized manner to avoid having to redo things over and over.

Implement the component as if you were actually going to use it, e.g. make the text field editable. No javascript is required.

The CSS editor is set to use Less as the preprocessor. You may change it to use SCSS should you prefer.

Everything needed to complete the task is available here. Don't remove any existing code, simply add your own. You are allowed to look up external references.

Your component will render as you type and be positioned beneath the image. If it is no longer updating you likely have a syntax error.


We hope you do well and thank you for taking the time!
